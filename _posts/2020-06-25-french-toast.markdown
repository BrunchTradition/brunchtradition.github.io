# Recipe

* 3 Large Eggs
* 1 Cup Milk
* 1 Tablespoon Honey or Sugar
* Pinch of Nutmeg
* Pinch of Cinnamon
* Butter for Frying
* White bread
* Maple Syrup for serving (I like Kirkland)

1. Heat a skillet to medium
1. Whisk eggs and add the Milk, Honey or sugar, Nutmeg, and Cinnamon. Continue whisking until all ingredients are well combined.
2. Submerge bread in egg mixture for about 5 seconds on each side. Allow excess egg to drip before placing on the heated, buttered skillet. Repeat this step for the rest of the bread.
4. Enjoy!

Tip: If cooking for a large gathering, place a plate in an oven heated to 200Â° Fahrenheit and add finished French Toast to the plate until all the French Toast is made and you are ready to eat.
