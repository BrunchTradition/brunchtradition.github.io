# Recipe

* 3 Large Eggs
* 1 Cup Milk
* 1 Tablespoon Honey or Sugar
* Pinch of Nutmeg
* Pinch of Cinnamon
* Butter for Frying
* White bread
* Maple Syrup for serving (I like Kirkland)

1. Heat a skillet to medium
1. Whisk eggs and add the Milk, Honey or sugar, Nutmeg, and Cinnamon. Continue whisking until all ingredients are well combined.
2. Submerge bread in egg mixture for about 5 seconds on each side. Allow excess egg to drip before placing on the heated, buttered skillet. Cook until it has reached the perfect golden color and then turn to cook the other side. I like to swirl the pan around after turning so the toast can soak up any excess butter, this helps to achieve a nice golden finish on both sides. Repeat this step for the rest of the bread.
4. Pour Maple Syrup and any other desired toppings to your liking. Cooking for a crowd? Have a variety toppings so they can dress their French Toast to their liking. Enjoy!

Tips: 

* If cooking for a large gathering, place a plate in an oven heated to 200Â° Fahrenheit and add finished French Toast to the plate until all the French Toast is made and you are ready to eat.

* Use two pans to cook more french toast in a shorter amount of time.
