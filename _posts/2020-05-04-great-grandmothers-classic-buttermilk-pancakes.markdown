It’s quite difficult to argue that pancakes are not the quintessential American breakfast food. How can something be so simple yet also be incredibly satisfying? This recipe comes from my great grandmother who lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts her entire life. She often spoke about when she would frequently make this recipe for my grandmother during World War II. She has graciously given me permission to share her recipe for the world to cherish and enjoy.

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups All-Purpose Flour
* 3 Tablespoons Sugar
* 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder
* 1 Teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
* 1 Large Egg
* 2 cups Buttermilk
* 2 Tablespoons Melted Butter
* 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract

**Instructions**

1. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.
2. Beat egg in another bowl then stir in the other wet ingredients
3. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and mix until just together. Ensure that you do not over mix. Allow the pancake batter to rest for at least 10 minutes.
4. Ladle desired quantity of batter onto greased cooking surface heated just below medium.
5. Flip pancakes when the top has bubbled and looks slightly dry.
6. Continue to cook until bottom is perfectly golden brown.
7. Serve hot with warm maple syrup and other toppings as desired.

Great Grandma’s Tip: If cooking for a large gathering, place a plate in an oven heated to 200° Fahrenheit and add finished pancakes to plate until all the pancakes are made and you are ready to eat.
