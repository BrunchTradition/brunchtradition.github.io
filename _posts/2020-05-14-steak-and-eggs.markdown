Imagine this. You wake up bright and early in the morning. The sun is out, just peeking over the horizon but enough to wake you from a deep night’s sleep. There is a powerful aroma floating through the air. You inhale deeply, awakening your sense of smell and taste as the aroma becomes more apparent. What is that delicious scent? Suddenly the realization hits you, and you smile, knowing there is a drool-worthy dish waiting for you in the kitchen; it can only be steak and eggs.

Growing up as a child- even into adolescence- my family always valued the beautiful, succulent combination of steak and eggs. Steak is a rich cut of meat that, when cooked just right, can bring on an otherworldly array of flavor. This is also true for eggs that are cooked fresh from the market- or even from the farm if you raise your own chickens. One can only be so lucky. The flavors in the steak pair wonderfully with eggs because they are both considered “bases” that can be built upon with side items and garnishes. When cooked in unison, they mix almost too smoothly, but what is the origin of this traditional combination?

The history of how this dish became a staple in many households is quite interesting. Let us take a brief trip into the past, starting in the 1950s – 1970s. This was a time in American culture when eating healthy portions of protein was a top priority for the common man/woman. Scarfing down meat and eggs at any time of day meant health, wealth, and survival. Nutrition was not so much a concern as it is in 2020, but this is no surprise since going to sleep with a full belly at the end of a long work-day overshadowed any concept of “going green” or relying on salad to stay satiated. Nevertheless, a shift began to take place in the diet world, and regularly consuming hearty meals like steak and eggs were better left to athletes and bodybuilders.

On May 5, 1961, a game-changer occurred that cemented steak and eggs into American history. NASA astronaut Alan Shephard decided he needed a low-maintenance meal filled with loads of protein to keep him full throughout his flight into space that day. He woke up, ate a filling meal of steak and eggs, and then launched himself into space. Since then, NASA has adopted the dish as their traditional, legendary breakfast of choice. History speaks for itself; this dish truly is a foundation in American cuisine.

Nowadays, no matter if you are an athlete, astronaut, or accountant, everyone can enjoy the full-flavored experience of this meal. While it might not be a dish eaten every day, it is definitely worth splurging on for Sunday brunch or a date-night with your loved one. Not only is it delicious, but it is also easy to whip up, adding your own personal twist with garnishes and seasonings. I hope you enjoy mastering this steak and eggs recipe no matter the decade, time of day, or location (yes, outer space counts). Now, let’s get to cooking.
